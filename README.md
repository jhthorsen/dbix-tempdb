# DESCRIPTION

[DBIx::TempDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3ATempDB) is a module which allows you to create a temporary database,
which only lives as long as your process is alive. This can be very
convenient when you want to run tests in parallel, without messing up the
state between tests.

This module currently support PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite by installing the optional
[DBD::Pg](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3APg), [DBD::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3Amysql) and/or [DBD::SQLite](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD%3A%3ASQLite) modules.

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/jhthorsen/dbix-tempdb/issues)
or pull request for more backend support.

# CAVEAT

Creating a database is easy, but making sure it gets clean up when your
process exit is a totally different ball game. This means that
[DBIx::TempDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3ATempDB) might fill up your server with random databases, unless
you choose the right "drop strategy". Have a look at the ["drop\_from\_child"](#drop_from_child)
parameter you can give to ["new"](#new) and test the different values and select
the one that works for you.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

## DBIX\_TEMP\_DB\_KEEP\_DATABASE

Setting this variable will disable the core feature in this module:
A unique database will be created, but it will not get dropped/deleted.

## DBIX\_TEMP\_DB\_URL

This variable is set by ["create\_database"](#create_database) and contains the complete
URL pointing to the temporary database.

Note that calling ["create\_database"](#create_database) on different instances of
[DBIx::TempDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3ATempDB) will overwrite `DBIX_TEMP_DB_URL`.

# METHODS

## create\_database

    $self = $self->create_database;

This method will create a temp database for the current process. Calling this
method multiple times will simply do nothing. This method is normally
automatically called by ["new"](#new).

The database name generate is defined by the ["template"](#template) parameter passed to
["new"](#new), but normalization will be done to make it work for the given database.

## dsn

    ($dsn, $user, $pass, $attrs) = $self->dsn;
    ($dsn, $user, $pass, $attrs) = DBIx::TempDB->dsn($url);

Will parse ["url"](#url) or `$url`, and return a list of arguments suitable for
["connect" in DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI#connect).

Note that this method cannot be called as an object method before
["create\_database"](#create_database) is called. You can on the other hand call it as a class
method, with a [URI::db](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3A%3Adb) or URL string as input.

## execute

    $self = $self->execute(@sql);

This method will execute a list of `@sql` statements in the temporary
SQL server.

## execute\_file

    $self = $self->execute_file("relative/to/executable.sql");
    $self = $self->execute_file("/absolute/path/stmt.sql");

This method will read the contents of a file and execute the SQL statements
in the temporary server.

This method is a thin wrapper around ["execute"](#execute).

## new

    $self = DBIx::TempDB->new($url, %args);
    $self = DBIx::TempDB->new("mysql://127.0.0.1");
    $self = DBIx::TempDB->new("postgresql://postgres@db.example.com");
    $self = DBIx::TempDB->new("sqlite:");

Creates a new object after checking the `$url` is valid. `%args` can be:

- auto\_create

    ["create\_database"](#create_database) will be called automatically, unless `auto_create` is
    set to a false value.

- create\_database\_command

    Can be set to a custom create database command in the database. The default is
    "create database %d", where %d will be replaced by the generated database name.

    For even more control, you can set this to a code ref which will be called like
    this:

        $self->$cb($database_name);

    The default is subject to change.

- drop\_database\_command

    Can be set to a custom drop database command in the database. The default is
    "drop database %d", where %d will be replaced by the generated database name.

    For even more control, you can set this to a code ref which will be called like
    this:

        $self->$cb($database_name);

    The default is subject to change.

- drop\_from\_child

    Setting "drop\_from\_child" to a true value will create a child process which
    will remove the temporary database, when the main process ends. There are two
    possible values:

    `drop_from_child=1` (the default) will create a child process which monitor
    the [DBIx::TempDB](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3ATempDB) object with a pipe. This will then DROP the temp database
    if the object goes out of scope or if the process ends.

    `drop_from_child=2` will create a child process detached from the parent,
    which monitor the parent with `kill(0, $parent)`.

    The double fork code is based on a paste contributed by
    [Easy Connect AS](http://easyconnect.no), Knut Arne BjÃ¸rndal.

- template

    Customize the generated database name. Default template is "tmp\_%U\_%X\_%H%i".
    Possible variables to expand are:

        %i = The number of tries if tries are higher than 0. Example: "_3"
        %H = Hostname
        %P = Process ID ($$)
        %T = Process start time ($^T)
        %U = UID of current user
        %X = Basename of executable

    The default is subject to change!

## url

    $url = $self->url;

Returns the input URL as [URI::db](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3A%3Adb) compatible object. This URL will have
the [dbname](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3A%3Adb#dbname) part set to the database from ["create\_database"](#create_database),
but not _until_ after ["create\_database"](#create_database) is actually called.

The URL returned can be passed directly to modules such as [Mojo::Pg](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo%3A%3APg)
and [Mojo::mysql](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo%3A%3Amysql).
